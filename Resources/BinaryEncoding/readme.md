# About

Binary encoding folder contains materials for activity where I show students how data are stored in computers. Especially it shows the following.

## Data formats

There exists multiple data formats. This is important because if file is an image, the computer needs to display it differently then when it is a text. And if it is a sound, it needs to know that it can play it.

## Guess file sizes

Let students guess, which file they think will be largest and which will be smallest. Talk about why they think so.
