Repository made to store materials for my coding club lessons.

My two accounts are here:
- teacher account: [hartmaj2](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/hartmaj2/)
- original account: [mandalore195](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/mandalore195/)

The accounts above contain studios where you can find useful projects if you are looking for inspiration on what to code with your students.
I must recommend the following studios for project ideas:
- [creative coding challenges](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/2538642/)
- [my selection from other teachers](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/36367250)
