# Ideas for lessons

## Set alarm before end so I have time to revise
- Prepare revision questions
- First just ask if they remember:
  - What concept we actually learned
  - Why is it useful (what game could I apply it in?)

## Use Scratch Task Cards
- Exercise for start of the lesson (I will not help here, they will have to figure themselves)
- Maybe use them for kids that are going to be faster

## Let every week somebody borrow the book about Scratch
- Motivation to exercise at home

## Show roadmap
- This will serve as an orientation plan what to learn for motivated kids

# Ideas to send to google class
- (Maybe to send them roadmap for the ones more interested)
- (Or for interesting resources: Griffpatch, Scrathc - Al Sweigart, CS Field Guide)
