# Notes about teacher accounts in Scratch

[source_file](https://resources.scratch.mit.edu/www/guides/en/scratch-teacher-accounts-guide.pdf)

- it is not possible to add existing profiles as students to a class

- I can create new students - they will have a login of my choice and password will be set to my profile name, they will then need to change the password to their own one
  - possibility to bulk add students using csv file with format: stud_name, stud_pwd

- possible to send a sign-up-link to students
  - this way, I could just post the link to my webpage for them to copy and join

## What is the advantage of having a class vs have just studio and their individual profiles?

- individual profiles
    - they have to search for my studio manually (takes time)
    - no way to set their password myself (so they can then forget it later) 

- class profiles
  - possible to change their passwords by me if they forget
  - only the student can delete their profile (but I can get his password so I can do that as well)
  - when they click on their profile, they see: student of 'classname' on the top left

## Additional notes

### Studios
- students cannot comment too frequently in the studio
  - there must be at least 30 seconds between any two messages sent
