# Structure of general lesson

## Riddle at start (5 minutes)
- Shows what can go wrong with some concept we learned 
- They have to think about it and whoever finds out first can share

## Simple warm-up exercises to do themselves (20 minutes)
- Revise stuff we learned last lesson (apply it)
- Can work in teams

## Main project (45 minutes)
- Learning new topic needed for game development 
  - types of blocks
  - control flow (if,else) 
  - loops
  - variables
  - clones

## Revision (5 minutes)
- First just ask if they remember:
  - What concept we actually learned
  - Why is it useful (what game could I apply it in?)
- If they don't remember ask about the stuff directly

## Write what they like on the board (5 minutes)
- Name + what they liked
