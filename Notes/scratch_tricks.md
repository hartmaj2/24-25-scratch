# Useful tricks in Scratch

## Useful Addons

- [Scratch Addons page](https://scratchaddons.com/)

- Editor find bar
  - Adds a find bar, that can be used to search for variables, blocks, broadcasts etc.
  - Also activated with ctrl + F
- Rename message
  - allows to rename a broadcast message
- Debug
  - useful is the new `breakpoint` commmand
  - when encountered, a window is shown
    - in `Threads` tab one can:
      - step through instructions one at a time
      - see threads, logs and other information about the process

## Paint editor

- one square is 4x4 px
- when creating a new shape - hold shift to make it regular
  - line - point in 8 possible directions
  - square/circle - all edges same length
- editing shape - hold option to resize while keeping the center fixed

## Editor tricks

- backpack
  - steal stuff from other projects (don't have to be your own)

- how to recognize recognize running code
  - code that is currently executed has yellow background

- screen size is in ratio 4:3 (480px:360px)

- run Scratch in turbo mode (computer will not refresh screen every time and will run faster)
  - shift + green flag

- fastest way to clone your project (eg. if you want to keep the old one for archiving purposes and work on a new copy)
  - in top bar of the project: `File` -> `Save as copy`

## Coding tricks

- detect touch of hidden objects
  - use `distance to` instead with some small value

- there exists a block that gives us x/y position of any Sprite you wish (so from one Sprite you can get information about a position of another Sprite)
  - ([y position v] of (Cat v))

## Interesting facts

- there exists a Teacher account that allows you to create classes
  - [teacher account](https://scratch.mit.edu/educators#teacher-accounts)

- 20 move blocks one after another will run immediately all; one move block inside a repeat 20 times block will run them slower

- Scratch has written language called scratchblocks
  - [rendering scratchblock language](https://scratchblocks.github.io)
  - [generate scratchblocks from Scratch project](https://apple502j.github.io/parse-sb3-blocks/demo.html)

## What to find out

- do clones react to messages?
  
- what events do clones react to?

- is there a better way to create power up drops instead of having to store the drop position in variables? (i.e. having drop_x, drop_y)
