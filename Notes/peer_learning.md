# Notes about peer learning in Scratch

## What is peer learning?

Peer learning means, that the kids help each other and act as a teachers to themselves as well. So I am not the only source of knowledge.

## Why peer learning?

- improves their communication skills (which I think are really important in life)
- by teaching, one understands the thing way better than before
- reading other people's codes will be a routine if they will be programmers
  - most of the good software is developed in big teams of people (together we are stronger)

## How to implement peer learning in classroom setting?

- !!! create the programs alongside from scratch
  - I can ask them what they recommend to do next
  - they see how the program evolves 

- !!! also possible to share their works in progress
  - either upload that to the studio right away
  - or they can just go from pc to pc

- after they finished their projects, let them share the projects with others
  - best to use Scratch studio for that as I can then just display it on the big screen
  - let them comment the game
  - they can tell me what to do, when I play the game

- when a kid manages to create a feature that is useful (high score, jumping etc.)
  - let the kid explain to others
  - tell others, they can go to that kid and ask for help (he will be the new source of knowledge for that feature, a kind of a professional/mentor on that thing)
