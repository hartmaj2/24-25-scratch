## Main goal

- rewise functions
- algorithmic thinking 
  - umime informatiku
- work on cookie clicker

## 0. Riddle with functions

- practice understanding functions (just how they work)
- single function call, nicely named

## 1. Umime informatiku - magic

[link](https://www.umimeinformatiku.cz/plosinovka#ps508)

- they already finished first levels
- now focus on planning what will happen
  - try to think about what exactly will happen
  - only start when they are sure where exactly the hero will go
  - it is a practice of imagination

- why practice imagination:
  - better imagine how a game will work if they design it
  - it saves time (you have to wait until you realize the hero dies just before the end)

- bonus: level 4 has multiple solutions (can they find all?)

## 2. Cookie clicker - improve the buying system

- add multiple items that we can buy
  - one item will increase click power
  - another item will increase cookies per second

- variables for:
  - click power
  - cookies per second

- bonus1: make price of the items increase every time we buy it

- bonus2: make nice visuals
  - glowing light spinning around cookie
    - use clones to have multiple rays
    - use color gradient [link](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Paint_Editor)
    - to make shape: use shift to preserve right angles
  - cookie increases size when click on it ()
    - use my sine function (just borrow it)
  - make items for which we don't have enough money darkened
    - have variable for states - unlocked/locked

- bonus3: make cursors appear rotating around the cookie
  - use clones
  - first - just rotate without offset
  - then after rotation -> make sure cursor moves from the center

- bonus4: make nice info messages
  - use variable hiding/showing
  - watch out for different items hiding messages of other items (each item should only hide its own messages)

# 3. Different game of choice

- dino jumper
  - start with gravity

- zombie shooter
