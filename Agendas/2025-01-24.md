## 1. Umime informatiku - magic

[link](https://www.umimeinformatiku.cz/plosinovka#ps508)

- they already finished first levels
- now focus on planning what will happen
  - try to think about what exactly will happen
  - only start when they are sure where exactly the hero will go
  - it is a practice of imagination

- why practice imagination:
  - better imagine how a game will work if they design it
  - it saves time (you have to wait until you realize the hero dies just before the end)

- bonus: level 4 has multiple solutions (can they find all?)

## 2. Cookie clicker - improve the buying system

- add multiple items that we can buy
  - one item will increase click power
  - another item will increase cookies per second

- variables for:
  - click power
  - cookies per second

- bonus1: make price of the items increase every time we buy it
- bonus2: make nice visuals
  - glowing light spinning around cookie
  - cookie increases size when click on it ()
    - use my sine function
  - make items for which we don't have enough money darkened
