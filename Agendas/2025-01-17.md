# Agenda 17.1.2025

## Main goal

- algorithmic thinking
  - recognizing repeating patterns (maybe functions/blocks)
- work on cookie clicker program
  - add more items to buy
  - think about possible upgrades

## 0. Practice - Mars Rover

- [nasa_rover_page](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance/)
- [nasa_rover_location_map](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance/location-map/)
- [nasa_rover_model](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/mars-perseverance-rover-3d-model/)

- [scratch_project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1121473200)

- we are programmers that will write the code to drive the Perseverance rover
- the program is transmitted far away and shorter message is easier to transmit
- try to use as few blocks of code as possible!

## 1. Work on cookie clicker

- add more upgrades
  - double/triple click power
    - forever
    - for some time only
  - cookie per second automatic generator
  - golden cookie falling sometimes so we can catch it and get additional cookies
