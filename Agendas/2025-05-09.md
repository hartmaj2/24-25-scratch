## Main goals

- understanding program written in python
  - motivation: if they want to continue next year, we will be coding in python
    - so understanding the code will help
    - also all programmers nowadays should understand python (good for making games in Roblox, Godot etc.)

- working with lists
  - motivation: store multiple entries of same kind
    - highscores of players
    - names of items that the player owns/clicked
      - good that we know in what order the items are in the list
  - what can we do with lists?
    - ask what item is at what position
    - add items
    - remove item

## 0. Kod kostky v pythonu

- motivation: why ability to read code and understand what it does is necessary?
  - nowadays, we will program with ChatGPT - it will write the code but we should be able to understand it in order to be able to use it effectively
  - most of the time, we collaborate on projects together with other programmers, many people have to work together to create a good program

- python
  - [we-used-it](https://missions.astro-pi.org/mz/code_submissions/new)
  - is used by professional programmers

- [link-python](https://www.umimeinformatiku.cz/kod-kostky-python-rozcvicka/84)

- limit umime informatiku se da obejit
  - napadlo by deti, jak je mozne ze i po znovu spusteni pocitac vi, ze jsme to porad mi a dosahli jsme limitu?
  - google - clear browsing data

## 1. Exercise with lists

- first showcase
  - adding few ingredients to a list
  - removing ingredients from list
  - removing everything from a list
  - why are these things useful? do they know some examples where it could be used in a game?

## 2. Potion making game

- [link-na-hotovy-projekt](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/915814226/fullscreen/)

- first - show what we want to reach (final program)

- simplified version: check if user clicked one item, item selected at random
  - show checkmark or cross
  - [example-solution](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1172572871/)

- next version: three random ingredients in right order

## 3. Plan for rest of the coding club

- next lesson - work more with lists on this game

- three more lessons after that
  - working on their project of choice (each can have their own)
