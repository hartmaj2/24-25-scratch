# Agenda for 11.4.2025

## Main goals

- revise where ciphers are used
  - do they know?
  - internet payments, logins

- how to learn by themselves
  - what would they do if I told them to make flappy bird without me helping them in any way?
  - would they use Google? ChatGPT? YouTube?

- competition
  - who can create jumping dot with realistic gravity (I will show them example)
  - bonus: flip gravity when space pressed

- make FlappyBird
  - start with only basic shapes which and implement game mechanics
  - add pretty costumes later when game mechanics finished

## 0. Revise ciphers

## 1. Learning resources

- do they sometimes learn stuff themselves from the internet?
  - how to do something in a game? 
  - how to do something for school? (calculate math, answers for homeworks)
  - how to make a game in Scratch?

- where on the internet do they look?
  - Google? ChatGPT? YouTube?

## 2. Competition

- finding on internet how to code something in Scratch
  - 1. make normal gravity
  - 2. make upside down gravity
  - in teams or alone
  - who can solve the problem fastest, everything is allowed

## 3. Making Flappy Bird

- we will use the code we made in part 2.

## TODO

- [ ] create sample solution for competition

- [ ] try to implement flappy bird and think about decomposition to sub problems
