  - if, if else
  - switch costume to XXX
  - touching XXX ?
  - hide/show
- Finish working on maze program
  
  
## Lesson plan

### 0. Practice - Puppy simulator

#### Instructions 
- Create a program where you can feed the puppy [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1079769909/)
  - the puppy eats the melon when you click on it
  - it only eats the melon if it is touching the melon!
  - the melon gets smaller when it is eaten
  - the puppy gets bigger when it eats a melon

#### Motivation
  - we will need this in our game!
  - 
#### What blocks to use
  - touching Watermelon
  - if else
  - next costume / switch costume to
  - hide
  - costume number (reporter block)
  - is lower/greater than (boolean block)
  - broadcast (maybe)

#### Notes
- Discuss and help each other 
- If too lost, ask me


### 1. Finish the maze program
- temporary solution from last lesson [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1076865869/)
- example solution [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1073646704/)
  - add enemies
    - they kill us if our costume number too low
  - add score 
    - each defeated enemy gives points
  - add timer 
    - finishing early can give points

### 2. Exercise on creating clones
- EASY: planting cactuses [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/900590141)
  - cat teleports to random locations and plants a cactus only when it is low enough (on the ground)
  - bonus: - make them grow after a while
- HARDER: screen saver
    - by pressing enter we spawn a ball that goes and bounces of the edges
