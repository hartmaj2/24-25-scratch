# Agenda 20.12.2024

## Main goals

- exercise algorithmic thinking
  - devise a precise sequence of steps someone could follow to be able to sort cards
  - explain what is an algorithm
- finish and demonstrate projects from last time
  - space shooter 
- some christmas themed exercise to motivate them
  - doesn't have to be scratch

## 0. Finish space shooter games from last lesson

- add score 
- add winning screen
- add boss
- make more levels with harder and harder enemies

- present the games in our [studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/35682881)

## 1. Sorting algorithm

- [link](https://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/sorting-algorithms/)

- motivation: 
  - Christmas is getting close and Santa needs to distribute Christmas gifts properly
  - Santa is on a "sluzebni cesta" on the south pole and cannot sort the boxes himself
  - first he needs to come up with a "procedure", "postup", how to sort it
  - the elves should be able to read it and follow the steps
- rules:
  - Santa has boxes of candies with different amount of candy
  - there is the same amount of kids which each have been good or bad on some scale
  - Santa has the list of how good the kids were from 1 to 8
  - we want to give the right amount of candy to the kids based on how good they were
- teams:
  - split into two teams
  - come up with a "cookbook" like procedure that will tell the other team steps they should follow to sort the candy boxes
  - write it down and hand it to the other team which will then try to sort the candies using their procedure
- goal:
  - sort the boxes using as little comparisons as possible - the boxes are heavy and we don't want to be carrying them around too much
  - come up with a "cookbook" telling 

- challenge: 
  - 20 comparisons
  - who can get the least possible comparisons

## 2. Searching algorithm

[link](https://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/searching-algorithms/?start-level=2)

- Santa has score for each kids how good they are
- he forgot the list of sorted kids so now he only has his app where he can see the score when he types a name
- he knows the boxes are sorted but he doesn't know the scores
- elves didn't have glue so the score for each box is written on a paper inside the box
- help santa find the right box so he must search the least amount of boxes necessary

## 3. Christmas clicker

- [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/779552593/)
- they can have their own topics
  - monster slayer
  - cookie clicker
  - money maker
  - homework maker

## 4. Scratch coding cards

- just solve different problems on the cards
