# Agenda 18.10.2024

## Lesson goals
- Review how if/else inside another if/else works
  - Riddle at start
  - What goes inside a condition - true/false
- Finish and present maze programs
- Asking player for answer
- Introduce cloning
  - Why is it useful?

## Lesson plan

### 0. Riddle: Nested ifs, if vs if-else
- [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1083177321/)
- Ask if they understand what the program will do
  - Each student will try to set size and positions so that the given say block is activated (4 groups)
  - Tell difference between first (if) and second version (if else)
    - In what situation exactly will the code behave differently?
- Draw flowchart

### 1. Finishing maze programs
- Add score for the ones that are finished already
- Make sure the game is playable and post it to the studio

- Komentar k Jacovu [maze](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1076863718/)
  - Hezky vymysleny system kostymu (zdolani nepritele nam zase nastavi prvni kostym)
  - Lepe pojmenovat broadcasty - at se v tom pak vyzna
  - Pokud chytam broadcast ve stejne postave, jako ho vysila
    - umistit ten kod hned k tomu broadcastu a ne do if received - je to prehlednejsi
  - Celkove moc pekne - libi se mi kostym mysky a ze to vse hezky funguje

### 2. Getting players answers
- Program to choose character [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1083189995/)
- Useful for creating a quiz or letting the player choose its name/costume
- Introduce concept of variable
  - Place where I can store some information
  - I can use its name to access it
  - I can access it many times
- Finish the program by adding the rest of the choices 
  - just ask them, how they would write it

### 3. Create an annoying sibling/kid program
- Program that sazys why? until your answer because

### 4. Cloning
- why is it useful
  - more enemies of same type - each enemy is a clone
  - shooting bullet - each bullet is a clone
  - collecting start - each star a clone
- show cloning demo program [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1083201223/)
- program that asks you, how many clones you want to create

### 5. Top down shooter
- Make falling enemies (clones)
- I will just have to dodge the enemies first
- Then add possibility of shooting
  - Each shot should be a clone
- Add stars to collect
- Add points
- Add boss
