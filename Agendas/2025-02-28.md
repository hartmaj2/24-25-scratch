- showcase the end result for motivation
    - we will imagine we are a game studio and want to create this game
    - how will we start?

- create a plan of attack!
  - where should we start?
  - what parts can we work on separately?
  - what makes sense to do first?
  - what can be done later?

- proposed plan:
  - create chicken and its movement
  - create first enemy
    - we want the chicken code now to do two possible things
      - just move
      - move and also say ouch and then appear at start
      - WE WILL NEED IF STATEMENT MAGIC 
    - how to make the enemy move?
      - we need the code for enemy to repeat forever
      - the code of the enemy sometimes has to do three possible things
        - just go forward
        - maybe kill chicken
        - maybe turn the enemy to face other direction
  - create fence
    - how to make the chicken not be able to go through the fence?
    - MAGIC TRICK -> move the chicken forward but if it touches the fence at the end of the movement, teleport it back
