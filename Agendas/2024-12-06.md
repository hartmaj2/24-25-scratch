# Agenda 6.12.2024

## Main goals

- teach how computer stores data -> introduction to binary system


## 0. Binary numeral system

- numeral system (ciselna soustava)

- how is data in computer stored?
  - do they know what bytes and bits are?
    - show different sizes of files, disks, memory
  - why are computers digital?
    - everything stored as digits (but binary digits)
  - do they know how computer stores everything as 0 and 1?
    - how is that possible?
    - using a numeral system with only 0 and 1
      - what numeral systems do they know?

- game with binary cards -> try uncovering the dots, what they expect the next amount of dots be?
- how to make a certain amount of dots showing
- this is how computer works -> if he wants to represent a number (amount of dots) the computer just flips cards (0 and 1)

## 1. New game in Scratch 

- space invaders?

- player movement
  - control both with wasd and up left down right
  - shoot

- shooting
  - using clones
  - let kids try different approaches step by step
    - appear
    - fly
    - disappear
  
- enemies
  - make them appear at random positions
  - make them appear at random intervals

- make bullets and enemy collisions
- add asteroids
  - must avoid and cannot shoot them
  - make asteroids have random sizes

- improvements
  - allow shoot only after some time interval passed
  - add score
  - add explosion
  - add boss
