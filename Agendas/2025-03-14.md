## Main goals

- work on the geometry shooter game

- focus on good code organization
- trying to develop the things without my help

## 1. Allowing enemies to damage my player

- TASK: do they know what the word "define" means?
  - definition - explanation/description of what something is

- now I don't want to code to become too mingled together, it would be nice to name the parts of code that do a similar job together
  - blocks for:
    - movement
    - collision detection
  - later I can define more blocks and my code will stay organized

- now we can program the collision detection into a single block

## 2. Spawning enemies at different positions

- define a block for spawning enemies

- first try spawning them at random places at the right of the screen

- then add possibility to spawn from left side also (use random coin toss)

- now we just do the same for top/down and just pick by random coin toss again

- put all the spawn code into a single block
  - "pick spawn position"

## 3. Adding different enemy types

- fast and slow

- IMPORTANT: now demonstrate again how the values "captain" sprite get copied into the clones
  - variable values
  - costume, size
  - position, rotation
  - shown/hidden status

- first just try to make enemies with different costumes

- then add different speed as well
  - IMPORTANT: create a "for this sprite only" variable `speed`

## 4. Count kills 

- that should be easy

## 5. Add power ups

- fast shots
- spread shots

- make fast shots a global variable
