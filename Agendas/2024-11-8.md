# Agenda 8.11.2024

## Brainstorm

- Hadanka na join
  - nejaky kod s promennou, kde nejaka postavicka rekne obsah te promenne pomoci join

- Nejake lehke cviceni na promenne 
  - minule delal problem join a 

## Concepts

- variables
  - variable name vs the name directly
- joining strings

## Lesson goals

- learn basics about how variables work and why they are useful
  - when we want to remember something (number or text)
- finish the Baldi program 
  - don't need to understand everything perfectly (but it would be good)
- start a new project which will include:
  - making clones
  - using variables (but only variables for all sprites)

## 0. Riddle: (a) literal vs variable, (b) same code different result

- first ask what the program will do without showing the content of the variable
  - ask: can we be certain what the program will print without knowing what is inside?
- then show the content and ask again

- then ask what the next piece of code will do
  - point out, that all the say statements look exactly the same

## 1. Practice: Fortune telling program

- just show the kids the result we want BUT NOT THE CODE!
  - tell them they will need to use variable
  - they will also have to use many ifs (don't use if else)
- think of different funny or not funny destinies
  - you will become very rich
  - you will lose lots of money
  - you will slapnout do hovinka
  - you will get a jednicka s hvezdickou
  - you will get a poznamka
- use say for 2 seconds to say the destinies

## 2. Show baldi with debugger

- maybe first show a version where I could cheat
  - I will store the result in a variable that I can see before Baldi asks me
- finish the code
  - ask the kids to add subtraction themselves
- then show what the resulting code does step by step (first test this alone at home)
