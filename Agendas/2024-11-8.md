# Agenda 8.11.2024


## Brainstorm

- Hadanka na join
  - nejaky kod s promennou, kde nejaka postavicka rekne obsah te promenne pomoci join

- Nejake lehke cviceni na promenne 
  - minule delal problem join a 


## Concepts

- variables
  - variable name vs the name directly
- joining strings


## Lesson goals

- learn basics about how variables work and why they are useful
  - when we want to remember something (number or text)
- finish the Baldi program 
  - don't need to understand everything perfectly (but it would be good)
- start a new project which will include:
  - making clones
  - using variables (but only variables for all sprites)


## 0. Riddle: (a) literal vs variable, (b) same code different result

- [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1092536401/)

- first the riddle on top
  - ask: what the program will do without showing the content of the variable
  - then ask: can we be certain what the program will print without knowing what is inside?
  - then show the content and ask again

- second the riddle on the bottom
  - point out, that all the say statements look exactly the same
  - ask: will the cat say the same thing three times in a row?
    - if not, what will the cat say?
  - show with the DEBUGGER


## 1. Practice: Fortune telling program

- [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1092565567/)
- main goal of this exercise for me is to see how they are doing with understanding variables and random numbers so far

- just show the kids the result we want BUT NOT THE CODE!
  - tell them they will need to use variable, pick random number
  - they will also have to use many ifs (don't use if else)
- think of different funny or not funny destinies
  - you will become very rich
  - you will lose lots of money
  - you will slapnout do hovinka
  - you will get a jednicka s hvezdickou
  - you will get a poznamka
- use say for 2 seconds to say the destinies


## 2. Show baldi with debugger

- [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1090138246/)
- explain what was hard in Baldi program at end of last lessson
- go though the codes below comments with corresponding order written on top
- start from botton left

- recapitulate what we did last lesson
  - addition by hard coding the numbers inside

- show other possible solutions where we use
  - the fact that scratch can calculate the result for us
  - variables which help us because we don't have to rewrite the numbers multiple times

- show code on top
  - demonstrates pick random and how it can be composed with say block

- show code on top right
  - demonstrates assigning in variables does no magic, it just runs in order of operations


## 3. 2D game of choice

- CUSTOMIZE THE GAME WITH OWN PICTURES (can add sounds at home)

- next we will imagine we are a game development studio
  - what would be our name?

- we are not so experiences so we need to pick something 2D and not too hard so we can actually program it and earn some money

1. We need to choose a game we will program
   - ideas:
     - favorite game, game based on movie/series
     - inspiration: Creative Coding Challenges [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/2538642)
2. Each person presents their idea and writes it on board
3. Each person gives one vote to another program

- now we need to create a plan how to program the game
  - why we need a plan?
    - so we know where to start and don't get overwhelmed or lost in the amount of work
  - decompose the problem into smaller subproblems that when joined together solve the whole

1. Clarify
   - goal of the game?
   - when does the game end?
2. What objects exist in the game
   - single
     - player
     - finish
     - start
   - multiple (clones)
     - enemies
     - shots
     - obstacles
     - bonuses
3. How do objects interact
   - when player touches enemy - enemy dies, player loses health
   - when player touches bonus - player gets health/points
   - shot must appear at player etc.

- now we are clear at what happens in the game, lets make a plan:

1. What would be easiest to start with?
2. Can we first create a prototype version of something more complicated?
   - e.g. if there is something multiple times, create just one instance
   - if something has to be positioned precisely
     - just position anywhere at first and then correct later
   - instead of general solution, first, just hard code the solution
