## Main goals

- introduce kids to cryptography
  - what is a cipher?
  - why was it used in history?
  - examples of ciphers
  - why is it used now?

- build Caesar cipher wheel with them
  - make teams
  - use it to decipher messages that I will prepare
  - try to cipher messages and send it to the other team/s

## 1. Introduce ciphers

- first, talk about what a cipher is
  - way to make message unreadable for anyone who does not have a key
  - key - some procedure to decipher (decrypt) the message

- types of ciphers
  - writing the words reversed
  - numbers instead of letters
  - exchanging neighboring letters
  - Caesar cipher
  - do they know any more?

- make teams and create cipher wheels
  - then decipher the texts I prepared
  - they will use the ciphers I introduced
  - time, who can decipher all messages the fastest

- this is nice, but are they really useful?
- where are ciphers used in real world?

- show how I can see data sent over internet through wireshark if not ciphered
  - http vs https

- online web page to create ciphers
  - [link](https://cryptii.com/)
  - [link](https://www.101computing.net/cipher-wheel.html)

## 2. Revise how coordinates work 

- coordinates are helpful (last time, Emi and Simca used them and they created a very good copy of the original lego building)

- [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1153959252/)

- just to see if they understand the coordinates
- who can finish the game fastest

## 3. Talk time

- did they like sharing their work in the studio so others could see them as well?

- do they sometimes play around with Scratch at home?
  - show them griffpatch tutorials
  - [link](https://www.youtube.com/@griffpatch/playlists)

## 4. Work on Zombie shooter

- triple shot

## 5. Work on Flappy bird

- first show example of flappy bird
  - [link](https://flappybird.io/)

- explain how gravity works

- how should we plan our attack on the game:
  - create jumping movement
  - create obstacles
