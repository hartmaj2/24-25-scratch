# 2.5.2025

# Main goals

- exercise code understanding 
  - kod kostky exercise

- team work
  - pass around game
  - maybe choose a topic for the game (each person chooses at the start)

## 0. Umime informatiku - kod kostky

- motivation: understanding python code, thinking precisely

- [kod-kostky](https://www.umimeinformatiku.cz/kod-kostky)

- normally, computers are kind of like our slaves
  - we can just send them programs i.e. commands that tell them what to do, and they have to follow those commands
- imagine an evil world, where computers have taken over us, they give us programs that we have to follow
  - who can be the best computer in our class?

- we will learn how to understand Python language
  - do they remember when we worked with it?

## 1. Pass it on game

- motivation: understanding other people's code, collaborating with others

- [rules_here](../TeamGames/pass_around_game.md)
- rounds of 10 minutes
- first student selects the game name and writes in comment what the game should be about

- we will use the profile as before
  - to see their names: show them the students section in `MyClasses` -> `DDM 24-25` 

- fun tip:
  - show how they can pick a profile picture
    - profile -> click on icon
  - they can also use gif
    - do they know what that is?

- show how they create and share a project
  - inside the project: `Share` -> type name -> `Add to studio` -> pick the correct studio
- show how they can access the studio:
  - `My Classes` -> see the studio there

## 2. Talk about plan for the last four lessons

- motivation: independence, creativity, planning

- the lesson after the next lesson
  - start working on their own games
  - will have 3 total lessons to work on it
  - 4:30 h total working time

## 3. Introduce lists

- show [obchod project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1169227729/)

- what are lists
  - container for storing things (one thing can be there mutliple times)
  - thing can be: word, number

- what can we do with lists
  - add things
  - remove things
  - ask if something is inside
