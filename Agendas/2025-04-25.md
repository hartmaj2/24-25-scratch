# 25.4.2025 Lesson plan

## Main goals

- understanding written code
  - game on Umime informatiku, where they are the computer that receives the programs
- challenge with assymetric cryptography
  - how to deliver a message securely over untrusted channel using two locks
  - explain analogy with real life (shopping online)
- creating t-rex game in teams?
  - maybe use Scratch teacher account with classroom somehow
  - read about how classroom works

## 0. Umime informatiku - kod kostky

- [kod-kostky](https://www.umimeinformatiku.cz/kod-kostky)

- normally, computers are kind of like our slaves
  - we can just send them programs i.e. commands that tell them what to do, and they have to follow those commands
- imagine an evil world, where computers have taken over us, they give us programs that we have to follow
  - who can be the best computer in our class?

## 1. Assymetric cryptography

- imagine an evil world, where you have to send some private data over the internet
  - can you trust, that nobody can read the data when you send it on internet?
  - what kind of examples of such data do you know? what would one want to send somebody, without it being revealed?
- rules of the game:
  - two sides that need to exchange a secret message inside a box
    - each side has a lock and a key to that lock
    - one side has a box and a message that they want to send
  - the box can only be sent over insecure channel (other kids standing in a line)
  - the kids from the insecure channel want to steal what is inside the box
  - they cannot break the box because that would also break the secret inside (THAT IS OUR SPECIAL RULE)
  - interesting thing that can be done: !lock can be locked without having the key!

- asymmetric cryptography works the same way
  - locking can be done without being able to unlock the message afterward
  - only the person with the key can then open the thing
  - but anybody, who has access to the locking mechanism can lock a message

- practical team game: getting the message to your teammate
  - two or more teams
  - each member of the team gets a secret message from me, that they have to send over to the other team
  - transfering a message to your teammate is worth 1 point
  - intercepting an enemy message and writing it down is worth 1 point as well
  - they will have 10 minutes to try to figure out how to do this (Internet, ChatGPT, YouTube)
  - after that, I will show them how this can be done in practice and we can do a second round to see, who can actually make it work
  
- important team game notes:
  - they must sit at their computer only during the game
  - they have to collect other secret keywords by writing them down to their piece of paper
  - at the end of the game limit, we will then assemble points based on messages collected
  - TRY TO NOT LOOK AT SCREENS OF OTHER STUDENTS

- preparation
  - print paper with secret codes and hand them out to students


- [rsa-encryption-simulator](https://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/chapters/coding-encryption/the-key-distribution-problem/)

- TODO:
  - find a channel, over which we will be able to chat in this way (best to use Scratch)
  - create note special for this activity 
  - try deleting and adding more student accounts
  - changing a password of a student account
  - add also an enemy and try to interecpt a message or something (one will send private key)

## 2. Scratch t-rex game (in teams)

- idea: 
  - they are a game studio and need to cooperate to create a t-rex game
  - they can work on multiple computers and share their projects together by remixing and sharing on Scratch (that would be good to test ahead, if that will really work well)

- TODO:
  - read what I can do with the teacher account

- TODO:
  - create class with four student
  - log in to some and try to simulate my idea for cryptography game
