# 25.4.2025 Lesson plan

## Main goals

- understanding written code
  - game on Umime informatiku, where they are the computer that receives the programs
- challenge with assymetric cryptography
  - how to deliver a message securely over untrusted channel using two locks
  - explain analogy with real life (shopping online)
- creating t-rex game in teams?
  - maybe use Scratch teacher account with classroom somehow
  - read about how classroom works

## 0. Umime informatiku - kod kostky

- [kod-kostky](https://www.umimeinformatiku.cz/kod-kostky)

- normally, computers are kind of like our slaves
  - we can just send them programs i.e. commands that tell them what to do, and they have to follow those commands
- imagine an evil world, where computers have taken over us, they give us programs that we have to follow
  - who can be the best computer in our class?

## 1. Assymetric cryptography

[rules-here](../TeamGames/cryptography_game.md)

- imagine an evil world, where you have to send some private data over the internet
  - can you trust, that nobody can read the data when you send it on internet?
  - what kind of examples of such data do you know? what would one want to send somebody, without it being revealed?
- rules of the game:
  - two sides that need to exchange a secret message inside a box
    - each side has a lock and a key to that lock
    - one side has a box and a message that they want to send
  - the box can only be sent over insecure channel (other kids standing in a line)
  - the kids from the insecure channel want to steal what is inside the box
  - they cannot break the box because that would also break the secret inside (THAT IS OUR SPECIAL RULE)
  - interesting thing that can be done: !lock can be locked without having the key!

- asymmetric cryptography works the same way
  - locking can be done without being able to unlock the message afterward
  - only the person with the key can then open the thing
  - but anybody, who has access to the locking mechanism can lock a message

- practical team game: getting the message to your teammate
  - two or more teams
  - each member of the team gets a secret message from me, that they have to send over to the other team
  - transfering a message to your teammate is worth 1 point
  - intercepting an enemy message and writing it down is worth 1 point as well
  - they will have 10 minutes to try to figure out how to do this (Internet, ChatGPT, YouTube)
  - after that, I will show them how this can be done in practice and we can do a second round to see, who can actually make it work

- preparation
  - print paper with secret codes and hand them out to students
  - create a studio inside my class at hartmaj2 profile
  - share a link using which they can create their own profiles exactly for that class

## 2. Talk about what we will do in next weeks and recapitulate

- next week: 
  - activity, where we will pass around Scratch projects (remixing game) in circle and create multiple games at once
    - rounds of 10 minutes for about 6 rounds, then we will see the results and demonstrate them in front of the whole class

- later on:
  - their own projects (they will come up with their own idea what they want to do)
  - each student can do their own project of choice
  - I will be a mentor who will help them realize their project
  - their job will be to plan carefully what they want to add to the game (use paper notes or computer notes)
  - ask me good questions that will help them create their game
