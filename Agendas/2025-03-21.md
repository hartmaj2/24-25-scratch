## Main goals

- participate on the AstroPi challenge
  - experience, what a Python code looks like
    - error messages
    - typing text code

## 0. AstroPi challenge participation

- team code: camp-dour

- objective:
  - create a 8x8 pixelart that will be played on ISS (International Space Station)
  - create variables for colours we will use
  - display an image on Sense HAT
  - use the sensor of the astro pi to sense the color of light on ISS

- result:
  - astronauts will run the program on the ISS
  - receive a certificate with following data:
    - team name
    - team members name
    - map showing a location where ISS was when the program was run
  - I will get an email for each submission

- introduction:
  - describe what Astro Pi is
    - Raspberry Pi computer (small board with a chip) + Sense HAT (sensors)
    - Sense HAT has:
      - LED matrix
  - the computer is programmed using Python code
    - Python - very popular text based programming language
    - text based programming languages are very strict on the rules of how they should be written

- how to submit:
  - click on submit on bottom right
    - class code + team name
    - add all members (first name, age, gender)

- TODO: how to export pixilart images to python
  - maybe write a program that will convert it
