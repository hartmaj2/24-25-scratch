# Agenda 4.10.2024

## Lesson goals
- Revise new concepts from last lesson:
  - coordinates
  - repeat n-times

## Lesson plan

### 0. Practice - Falling snowflake
- Goal is to program a falling snowflake
  - YES: forever loop, change x/y by n, repeat n times, turn n degrees
  - NO: glide towards!
- Example solution [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1076697332)
- Motivation - falling enemies in space invaders [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-6pADy5Mdg&ab_channel=ClearCode)
- How to proceed:
  - think about subproblems first - just fall down, just go from left to right, just rotate
  - help each other with friends

### 1. Projects - Maze program

#### Intro
- Something like [this](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1073646704)

#### Setup
- Create maze using [maze generator](https://www.mazegenerator.net/)
  - shape - rectangular
  - style - orthogonal
  - width - 12
  - height - 9
  - download as svg!
- Upload the maze as a sprite and resize to 240
- (the maze can be of different size but MUST have width:height ratio 4:3)

#### Programming
- Program cat movement - just use events for arrows (simplicity)
- Program cat death - use if statement after movement; use touching Maze sprite to detect collision
- Program enemies - kill you based on costume/size; use touching to detect collision
- Program power ups - switch costume/size when picking power up

#### Bonus
-
