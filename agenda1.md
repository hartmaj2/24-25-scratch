# Agenda for day 1

## Introduction

### 1. Remembering names with gestures in cicrcle game
- I will write down on my laptop (prepare template in .md)
  - Name
  - Experience with coding (Scratch, Python, Html, Javascript, Arduino etc.)
  - Favorite game - they like to play
  - What would they like to learn here? How did they find out about this club?
  - Gesture

### 2. Motivation
- Why Scratch - easy to learn, hard to master and can make really cool games with it
  - [Geometry Dash](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/105500895/)
    - Player -> remove code from do die block
  - [Paper Minecraft](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10128407)
    - The fun part of coding is we can change the code to do what we like!
    - Steve -> CheckKeys -> set _sy to something else
    - Steve -> CheckKeys -> Set Walk
  
### 3. Set expectations
- What kind of games are we going to make (2D games, project at end)
  - [Zombie Shooter](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/791198994/)
  - [Dino Jumper](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/970811083/)
- What they see now is probably hard to understand 
  - We will every week explore new areas of this jungle of blocks
- Fun stuff on the side
  - how computer stores data, ciphers, how computer images work, card magic (fix broken data)
- Will serve as a gateway to build cool games with Unity later

### 4. Organisational
- Rules
  - Ask questions when not understanding (worst that happens is that I will be evil and don't tell you the answer!)
  - Don't worry about mistakes (nothing is going to explode, maybe?! )
  - Help your friends if you see they are stuck 
  - Play only your games
  - We want to be fit - swear word = 10 squats
- Create gmails 
- Sign everybody to Google Classroom
  - When I need to share some link with them
  - When they will share games so we can play them all

- What would they like to code? (game idea)
