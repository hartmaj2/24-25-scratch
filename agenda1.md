  - What would they like to code?
  - Why are they here? How did they hear about it?
  
### 2. Set expectations

  - control statements (if), loops (repeat n times,forever)
  - creating clones
  - variables

  - Ask questions when not understanding (there exists no stupid question)
  - Don't worry about mistakes (the more mistakes you make the more you learn)
  - Help your friends if you see they are stuck 
  - No playing games other than your own games (not even on Scratch)
  - We want to be fit - swear word = 10 squats

- Sign everybody to Google Classroom
  - When I need to share some link with them
  - When they will share games so we can play them all
  - (Maybe to send them roadmap for the ones more interested)
