# Useful tricks in Scratch

## Add ons

- Editor find bar
  - Adds a find bar, that can be used to search for variables, blocks, broadcasts etc.
  - Also activated with ctrl + F
- Debug
- Rename message

## Paint editor

- one square is 4x4 px
- when creating a new shape - hold shift to make it regular
  - line - point in 8 possible directions
  - square/circle - all edges same length
- editing shape - hold option to resize while keeping the center fixed

## Misc

- backpack
  - steal stuff from other projects (don't have to be your own)

- recognize running code: yellow background

- screen size is in ratio 4:3 (480px:360px)

- shift + green flag - run in turbo mode (computer will not refresh screen every time and will run faster)

- fastest way to clone your project (eg. if you want to keep the old one for archiving purposes and work on a new copy)
  - in top bar of the project: `File` -> `Save as copy`

- detect touch of hidden objects
  - use `distance to` instead with some small value

## Interesting facts

- there exists a Teacher account that allows you to create classes
  - [teacher account](https://scratch.mit.edu/educators#teacher-accounts)

- 20 move blocks one after another will run immediately all; one move block inside a repeat 20 times block will run them slower

- there exists a block that gives us x/y position of any Sprite

## What to find out

- do clones react to messages?
  
- what events do clones react to?

- is there a better way to create power up drops instead of having to store the drop position in variables? (i.e. having drop_x, drop_y)
