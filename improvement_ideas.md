# Ideas for lessons

## Set up my teacher account

  - recreate studios I had in my old project (just select the finalized project that are representative)
  - learn what new features will be useful for me

## Set alarm before end so I have time to revise
- Prepare revision questions
- First just ask if they remember:
  - What concept we actually learned
  - Why is it useful (what game could I apply it in?)
