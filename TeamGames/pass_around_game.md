## Rules

- rounds of 5 minutes
- in first round, you start creating a project of your choice (some kind of a game)
- after 5 minutes, you name the project as:
  - name of the person on your right + number of round (e.g. Honza 2)
- then, in next round, you remix the project with your name and the current round number
- we continue until you receive your own game

## Variants

- first student selects a topic and names the game in format "GameName NextPerson 1" (e.g. strilecka Dan 1)
  - then other students name it "GameName NextPerson i" where i is the round number

## Technical

- inside a class on a Scratch teacher account:
  - create a studio for this activity
  - explain kids how to name the project and share them
    - share -> type name -> add to studio -> pick the correct studio
  - to see the studio:
    - profile -> my class

## History

- tried it once with 6 students but we had rounds of length 5,5,3,3,2
  - students wanted to play longer
